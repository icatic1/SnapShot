## SI - Set 1

## Introduction

Snapshot is a Windows application that can be used to take photos and record videos on devices with one or multiple cameras. 
If these actions are event-triggered, the cameras turn on automatically when the specified event occurs, and store the recordings 
or photos on the local hard drive. The software supports both IP and USB cameras, but it was designed predominantly to be used with
1-3 USB cameras. It's recommended that the software is used on Windows 7 x86 or Windows 10 x64. Snapshot can be used offline as 
a desktop application, or accessed through our web application. The app is relatively lightweight, and it doesn't consume too 
many resources, which allows it to run alongside other applications. 

## Features:

- Silent install/deinstall using command prompt
- Event-triggered recording
- Preview of photos and recordings 
- Demo version for unregistered users
- Debug log
- Recording on motion detection
- Desktop and web app for both offline and online access
